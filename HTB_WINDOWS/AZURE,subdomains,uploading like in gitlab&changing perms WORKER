we got port ==3690== port open .. so we used svn

```
svn checkout svn://10.129.2.29
cat moved.txt
```

we found some ==subdomains== and it lead us to other subdoamins by viewing ==source code==

we did svn ==checkout== and ==diff== and got creds

```
svn checkout svn://10.129.2.29:3690
svn diff -r2
```

one subdomains needs creds and we got in

now in that it was like ==gitlab repos to upload== .. and so we made a  new branch in repo and uploaded aspx file and now we need to merge it to ==master== ..

so we ==created pull  request==

```
$make a branch (it said we cant upload in master we need to create apull request)
$upload file sthere
$create pull request and do Complete not AUTO_COMPLETE
$now see the name it was asubdomain and we can access it going there
```

we got shell now root

```
$using same creds in subdomain we got in the web page now 
$now we saw pipeline create like in jennekins
$newpipeline -> Azure repoes g -> PartsUnlimited -> Starter Pipeline 
$it gave us code and we can remove pool: Default to comile it without permission 
and add Script: net user Administrator Password@1
```
