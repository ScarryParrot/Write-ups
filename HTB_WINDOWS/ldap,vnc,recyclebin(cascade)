we used ==rpcc== to get usernames

but crackmapexec and other tools could not verigfy as we dont haev the password

so out of options we did ldap search and got some more info

==ldapsearch== -H ldap://10.10.10.182 -x -s base namingcontexts

```
ldapsearch -H ldap://10.10.10.182 -x -b "DC=cascade,DC=local" '(objectClass=person)'
```

and we got creds

these were smb creds at we got a lot of files .. one .reg file gave us creds for vnc password

which was cracked as

`echo -n <vnc_pass> | xxd -r -p | openssl enc -des-cbc --nopad --nosalt -K e84ad660c4721ae0 -iv 0000000000000000 -d -provider legacy -provider default | hexdump -Cv`

this was cred for s.smiths accont which gave us user.txt

now looking at net user s.smith

we saw    `Local Group Memberships *Audit Share *IT`

audit share was intresting and can be accessd over smb ..

from smb we found .db ==sqllite3== file and got hash which we decrypted from a exe function from smb file ..

so this was creds for arksvc another account which had elevation over ==recyclebins==

`Get-ADObject -filter 'isDeleted -eq $true -and name -ne "Deleted Objects"' -includeDeletedObjects`

`Get-ADObject -filter { SAMAccountName -eq "TempAdmin" } -includeDeletedObjects -property *`

it gave me admin creds
