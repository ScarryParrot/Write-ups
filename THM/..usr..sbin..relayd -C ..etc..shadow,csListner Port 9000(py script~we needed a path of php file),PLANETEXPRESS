port 9000 had a script that work .. by hacktricks but we needed a plugin php path in remote host

now the port 80 was open

ran gobuster ..config was there

now run gobuster with fasthits wordlist and we got config.yml

it had the path

now use ==port 80 as WAF== was there

and get shell

for priv esc

/usr/sbin/relayd it can make file readable so

/usr/sbin/relayd -C /etc/shadow

and read it
