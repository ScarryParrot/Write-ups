i found a comment which said many hsells here so we looked in git hub and found 16 shells name and on brueforcing we found shell nad got in

now we found a note saying lua script running and in bash history we found command to be executed

we did

`echo 'os.execute("/bin/bash")' > privesc.lua`

teh executed it `sudo -u sysadmin /home/sysadmin/luvit privesc.lua`

and got shell

we ran pspy and found this script running

which was updating the sshd _config

so we

echo 'chmod 777 /etc/passwd' >> 00-header

in the file which was updating in our case it was update_mod.d

and got root
