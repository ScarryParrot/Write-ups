it found a ==robots.txt== file cotained db username,password ,adn dbname

and a directory so we had to make make an admin panel using the creds and uplaod a payload to get shell

we got shell and used ==hydra== to crack users password on ssh

now for the root part

it had a file readcreds which read files and a root_backup_file which had root creds ..

so we used

`https://github.com/sroettger/35c3ctf_chals/blob/master/logrotate/exploit/rename.c`

and ==gcc== compiled it in the same directory

now

==touch asd==

==./rename asd root_backup_file==

and it read the file

just like creating a ==symlink== and then reading it
