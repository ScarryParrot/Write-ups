first we got 2 ports open as http

one port was for MATTERMOST .. this was not vuln to any injections and exploits

so we logged on helpdesk delivery .. where we created account and we got a internal email which we used to log in mattermost which sends

us mail to verify and we can read it from helpdesk ..

and we logged in mattermost

we got shel lfrom creds

and using mysql we got hash and using base64 rule we cracked password
