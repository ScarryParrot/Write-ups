file upload and we have to change the magic numbers ..

we create a file with 16-20 magic number of jpg or png then cat it with our php file then in burp chnage the extension

so

head -c 20 cutie.png > test

==cat== test aa.php > magical.php

done

we got shell from rce

then we used mysqldump as mysql was not available

mysqldump -u theseus -p iamkingtheseus Magic

or can also use --user=  --password=  --host=localhost dbname

then we got user shell from the password

root part

find perm said ==/bin/sysinfo==

==look for ltrace and strace sysinfo==

we found it opens fdisk in dev/shm

so we created file and put rev shell and we got root

on running ==sysinfo==
