on the main page there was a file upload section .. we tried all type of file upload tech but nothing worked

there was .git open so we cloned it and it had a ==magick== file

this pointed to ==imageMagic exploit== .. we did

`./magick -usage` and it gave us the version

we used this to create a file

`https://github.com/Sybil-Scan/imagemagick-lfi-poc`

and uploaded it and curl the resized image by the web application .. it executed the payload

we read /var/www/pil../db file and it had ssh creds

now for root we ran ==pspy== and it showed us the file in ==/usr/sbin==

adn also the cron where to put it

we did ***`binwalk --help`*** and got version

used this to create a png exploit file

`https://github.com/Sybil-Scan/imagemagick-lfi-poc`

and placed it in the directory showed by pspy and got shell
