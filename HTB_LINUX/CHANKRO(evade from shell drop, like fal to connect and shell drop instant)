`TryHackMe Bypass Disable Functions Walkthrough`

we tried all but cant get shell ..

the close we get by doing ==head of png into php== which connects to us but dies instantly

we found phpinfo.php it was blank at first then after we uplaoded our normal shell it gave us the ==DOCUMENT_ROOT== absolute path

so now we used ==CHankro .py t==o spawn us php file and we uplaoded it using GIF89a on top and it gave us shell
