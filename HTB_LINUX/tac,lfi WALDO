there was 2 api that was interacting with server fileRead and dirRead

the source from console said about the payload to pass path = . and we can read files ..

on using ==....//....//....//....//etc/passwd== we can read the file

and got id_rsa

we used the same id_rsa to log in montor .. the other user

it was rbash

so we used

`export PATH=/root/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin`

or

==ssh ss@localhost -t bash==

and got out of rbash

and ran linpeas

it had ==/usr/bin/tac=cap_dac_dir_read_search== highlighed

gtfo bin said and we read root.txt
