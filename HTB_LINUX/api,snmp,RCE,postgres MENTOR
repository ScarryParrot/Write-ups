we found the subdomain api

and it had tutorial how to login adn sign in iusing api

we followed it and signed in

on site there was a name James

so we tried bruteforce but no result

we found snmp open so we ran snmpbrute and found internal open

so snmpwalk we got creds for svc

we were in docker

we saw a directory API and i nit we saw a postsql link with ip and port running internally

so we used chisel and connected to it internally

and got svc real creds

now on running linpeas .. we found a file in snmp dir withjames creds and thus root was simple ..
