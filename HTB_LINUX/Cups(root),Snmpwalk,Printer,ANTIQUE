we got a 23 port and then we did udp

on connecting telent on port 25 it needs a pasword

so we did a snmpwalk on port 631 as it was open suggested by hacktricks

```
snmpwalk -v 2c -c public 10.10.11.107
snmpwalk -v 2c -c public 10.10.11.107 .1.3.6.1.4.1.11.2.3.9.1.1.13.0

we get hex and it was password
```

we did exec payload to get shell

then did chisel to get cups a1.6 on out localhost then msfconsole to get root
