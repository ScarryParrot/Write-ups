we scanned all port nothing then we burped on register page and saw admin=0 is bieng set

so we changed ot to 1 and now we can access admin.php

that page had json contents which contained name-Larvel, db name and base64 token

we searched on metasploit about laravel and it needs a token to give shell

and we got shell

now we ran linpeas and got creds leaked creds

we logged in then again linpeas gave leaked creds

we again logged in

now root part

we saw a file can be run as root

on running it said composer.json not found in /tmp

so we searched on gtfbins and it gave command and we got root

```
TF=$(mktemp -d)
echo '{"scripts":{"x":"/bin/sh -i 0<&3 1>&3 2>&3"}}' >$TF/composer.json
sudo composer --working-dir=$TF run-script x
```
