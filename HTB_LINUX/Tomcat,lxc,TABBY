we saw a page with ?path=dfdf  so we did a lfi and it worked

we saw the page at 8080 port was sugesting a path `usr/share/tomcat9/etc/tomcat-users.xml`

we got creds now we used metasploit ad got a shell

path i used was not normal ie ==/manager/html==  i used ==/manager/text==

we got a file in /var/www/html and its passwd was new users passwd

it was a ==lxd== account

means we can create a container and dump /root in it

used same command
